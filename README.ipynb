I obtained this dataset from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/oscarvilla/kickstarter-nlp. However, All this data was collected by webrobots.io, who did the web scrapping and have a lot more of data. They cleaned and tidied the scraped data, keeping just the two columns with blurbs in english and with final state of \"successful\" or \"failed\".\n",
